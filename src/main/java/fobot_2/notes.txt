Field class:
-> Should field store entities, makes frequent repositioning
   very inefficient... How to find out if entity is on a field then tho
   other than iterating all entities?
   Simple map that stores entities in buckets and entities can choose to
   remove themselves??



Chunk class:
-> Optimize entity checks like isFrontClear and entity updates using chunks.

-> Static entities are stored on a field, since they wont change positions
-> Dynamic entities are stored in chunks, and they keep their own position
    and when they exit a chunk, only then do we need to remove them from the chunk
    and add them to the next chunk.

> Increase lookup times by having a structure for each Entity type.
  Perfomance gains outweigh the additional header costs.
